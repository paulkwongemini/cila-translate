<h3>Shepherding according to God</h3>
“Shepherd the flock of God among you…according to God…” (1 Pet. 5:2)

“Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that
it may give grace to those who hear.” (Eph. 4:29)

In order to shepherd according to God, we need to become God in life, nature, expression, and function. We need to be
filled to the brim with the divine life, enjoying the Triune God as the fountain, the spring, and the river to become a
totality of the divine life, even to become the divine life itself. We need to become God in His attributes of love,
light, righteousness, and holiness. We need to be the reproduction of Christ, the expression of God, so that in our
shepherding we express God, not the self with its disposition and peculiarities. We need to become God in His function
of shepherding the flock of God according to what He is and according to His goal in His economy.

To shepherd according to God is to minister God to others. The Triune God is embodied in Christ and realized as the
consummated Spirit; this is the God whom we worship, proclaim, and minister to others. If we would minister God to one
another, we need to speak words of grace, truth, spirit, and life, ministering the processed God who has been wrought
into our being. (<i>Experiencing, Enjoying, and Expressing Christ (3)</i>, msg. 10, V.E.1-4, J.1-2)
<h3>The Living Vision of the Heavenly Christ</h3>
“And when they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.” (Matt. 2:10)

The star is the living revelation, the up-to-date vision that human concepts can never teach. After receiving the living
vision, the magi were misled by their human concept and went to Jerusalem. When the magi were corrected by the
Scriptures and restored to the right track, the star appeared to them again; living vision always accompanies the
Scriptures.

The priests and the scribes had knowledge concerning the birth of Christ, but unlike the magi, they did not see the
vision, nor did they have the heart to seek after Christ. It is easy to accumulate scriptural knowledge, but if we would
have living guidance, we must live in an intimate relationship with the Lord; we must be one with Him. (<i>2025
	Thanksgiving Conference</i>, msg. 1, II.C, E, G.1; II.G.2,4)

The Scripture, the word of God, is the breathing out of God…The Scripture is the embodiment of God as the Spirit. The
Spirit is therefore the very essence, the substance, of the Scripture, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in
matches. We must strike the Spirit of the Scripture with our spirit to catch the divine fire. As the embodiment of God
the Spirit, the Scripture (God’s word) is also the embodiment of Christ. Christ is God’s living Word (Rev. 19:13), and
the Scripture is God’s written word (Matt. 4:4). (2 Tim. 3:16, note 2)

Let us pray for the Lord to always give us a heart to seek Him and live in an intimate relationship with Him. May He
make us those who regularly strike the Spirit of the Scripture to know the Bible and to have an up-to-date, living
vision.

Please pray for the release and receiving of the Lord’s speaking in this training. Such trainings are a precious
heritage in the Lord’s recovery. The purpose of these trainings is to minister the all-inclusive Christ as eternal life
embodied in the word of God to bring the believers to the full knowledge of the truth so that they may enjoy Christ as
life, grow in life unto maturity, and dispense life to others for the growth and building up of His Body.

May the Lord grant us to highly value the semiannual trainings and encourage others to have a heart for them, and may
the Lord grace us to bear the burden to pray for the trainings so that He as the seven Spirits of God may have an
unhindered way to continue to speak the present truth to the churches.
<h3>University Conference for Germany, Switzerland, Austria</h3>
The University Conference for students and young adults from Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and beyond is December 5 to
7. The saints will once again gather at Gut Elim to seek the Lord’s presence, sit at His feet, and listen to His Word
(Luke 10:39).

May the Lord grant each attendee mercy and grace (Heb. 4:16) to have a pure heart (Matt. 5:8) and be poor in spirit
(Matt. 5:3), so that they may receive freshly from the Lord what He wishes to say to this generation. May the Lord gain
many more young adults from these nations for the advancement of His move in Europe.
<h3>Brussels, Belgium</h3>
A conference will be held in Brussels, Belgium this weekend, December 6 to 7. Please pray for the release of the Lord’s
rich word to supply the saints and knit them together. Continue to pray for the strengthening of the Lord’s testimony in
this crucial city and for more saints to migrate there under the Head and in the Body.
<h3>Czech and Slovak Translation Work</h3>
The labor continues to translate the NT Recovery Version into the Czech and Slovak languages. It was a year ago when,
after thorough fellowship and many prayers, the translation team started their preparations for this project. This week,
the team finally begins the translation of the Gospel of Matthew. The translation of this book is expected to take until
June 2026. These first weeks and months are very crucial for the whole team of six translators, as they will still be
learning ways of working individually and corporately. It is also a new experience of applying everything they have
learned into practice, handling new translation tools, and establishing working procedures.

Please pray:
<ul>
	<li>For the Lord to be the team’s wisdom in setting the best principles for their work from the start.</li>
	<li>That the whole team be kept from unnecessary distractions to remain focused and on schedule.</li>
	<li>That the Lord Himself may become and remain the unique goal and focus of all the serving saints as they carry out
		their daily tasks.</li>
</ul>
